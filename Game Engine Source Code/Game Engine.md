# Game Engine From Scratch
Source Code: https://github.com/bhakam/Portfolio/tree/main/Game%20Engine%20Source%20Code  

•	Created game engine from scratch in C++  
•	Developed CPU driven, custom multiprocessing rasterization pipeline that achieves 60fps at 1080p  
•	Architected easy-to-use entity component system with low level control when necessary  
•	Modeled a physics engine paired with a collision detection system to power first-person-shooter game mechanics  
•	Created multiplayer netcode using raw Linux sockets and the TCP protocol  
•	Added cross-network lag compensation to enable smooth multiplayer gameplay under poor network conditions  
•	Developed a deterministic game loop to enable input only communication between clients and server for a reduced network bandwidth requirement, powering up to 1000 player game world  
•	Developed macro-based auto class serialization allowing arbitrary classes to work effortlessly with the multiplayer netcode, including remapping memory addresses across machines for a truly portable environment
